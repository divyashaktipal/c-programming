    following menu for the food items available to take order from the
    customer:
    1: Burger
    2: French Fries
    3: Pizza

    The program inputs the type of food and quantity. It finally
    displays the total charges for the order according to following
    criteria:
    Burger = Rs. 200
    French Fries= Rs. 50

    quantity of burgers. When user enters the quality, then depending on
    the quantity it should display total charges.
